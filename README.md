# HTTP Server
This is a simple http server in cpp. I've written this type of server in Rust and a few other languages.

It's a good way to refine my skills a bit.

## Features
- Parameter Fetching
- Trie-Based routing
- Ability to add new routes
- Custom responses (only string for now)

## TODOS
- Add response types (files, json, xml, etc.)
- Add response headers
- Wildcard routing
